Overview
This project focuses on analyzing transaction records for Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop with three locations in NYC. 
The dataset includes transaction date, timestamp, location, and product-level details. 
The primary objective is to gain insights into Maven Roasters' sales trends over time, identify peak business days, and determine the most and least popular products that contribute to revenue.

Analysis
1. Sales Trends Over Time
To understand how Maven Roasters' sales have trended over time, the project will employ time series analysis techniques. This involves visualizing sales data over different time intervals (days, weeks, months) to identify patterns, fluctuations, and overall trends. Insights gained from this analysis will help in making informed business decisions, such as optimizing inventory and promotional strategies.

2. Busiest Days of the Week
Determining the busiest days of the week involves analyzing transaction records to identify patterns in customer traffic. The project will explore whether specific days consistently exhibit higher sales volumes. Potential factors contributing to busy days could include weekday routines, weekends, or special events in the vicinity of the coffee shop locations.

3. Product Analysis

3.1 Most and Least Popular Products
Analyzing product-level details will reveal which items are the most and least popular among customers. This information can guide inventory management, allowing the coffee shop to optimize stock levels for high-demand products and potentially reconsider the marketing or placement of less popular items.

3.2 Revenue Contribution
Identifying products that contribute the most to revenue is crucial for strategic decision-making. By calculating the revenue generated by each product, the project will highlight key items that significantly impact Maven Roasters' overall financial performance. This insight can inform pricing strategies, promotions, and product development efforts.
